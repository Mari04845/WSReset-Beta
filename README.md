# WSReset-Beta
What is WSReset?

-Is a file that allows you to reset the microsoft store, but the system one is outdated and not works with the new version of the MS store.

That's why i created this! The file works literally the same as the old file does, but it's updated to run with the new Windows and newer version of Microsoft store.

This is the beta version (or canary) and is recommended to not use this on your local machine (in case you can't fix the MS store with the stable).

Here you can find:

Official beta download.

Old Windows 8 version.
